1. Description
================================================================================

The lexicon (available at http://labs.priberam.com/Resources/Subjectivity-Lexicon-PT.aspx) 
was build by translating the MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon [2] to Portuguese. The corpus 
was used for the first time in [1] for the task of fine-grained opinion mining, where it 
was used with a lemmatizer in order to annotate words with subjectivity information.

This package contains five files:
	README.txt  	--> This file
	LICENSE.txt 	--> License file 
	Priberam_Subjectivity_Lexicon_PT.txt  --> File with the Portuguese translation 
						  of the Subjective lexicon of [3]

You may also be interested the fine-rained opinion mining corpus for Portuguese 
that we used in [1] and that includes subjectivity annotations: the Priberam 
Fine-Grained Opinion Corpus, which is available at 
http://labs.priberam.com/Resources/Fine-Grained-Opinion-Corpus.aspx.

2. Portuguese Subjectivity Lexicon
================================================================================

==== 2.1 Data Format ====

The lexicon file (lexicon_pt.txt) is annotated in a CONLL format, each line providing 
information elements about a word, separated by tabs (see some line examples ahead): 

1st element - word form

2nd element - simplified part-of-speech (POS) tag, which can be: "N" (noun), 
	      "A" (adjective), "D" (adverb) , "V" (verb).

3rd element - intensity of subjectivity, which can be: "weaksubj" or "negative"

4th element - polarity of subjectivity, which can be: "negative", "positive", 
	      "neutral" or "both".


Since the lexicon was obtained by translating an English lexicon, different English words
(with different lexicon annotations) can map to the same Portuguese word. For this reason, 
the lexicon may have more than one possible subjectivity tag for the same pair word+POS.
This is the case of the word "abalar" in the examples ahead.

==== 2.2 Examples ====

à deriva	D	weaksubj	negative
à farta		D	strongsubj	positive
à vontade	A	weaksubj	positive
à vontade	D	weaksubj	positive
abalado		A	weaksubj	negative
abalar		V	strongsubj	negative
abalar		V	weaksubj	negative
